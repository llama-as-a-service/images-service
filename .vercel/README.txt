> Why do I have a folder named ".vercel" in my project?
The ".vercel" folder is created when you link a directory to a Vercel project.

The "project.json" file contains:
- The ID of the Vercel project that you linked ("projectId")
- The ID of the user or team your Vercel project is owned by ("orgId")
